<!-- Question 2 List five significant features of React -->

Component-based architecture: React is built around the concept of components, which allows developers to easily break down complex UIs into smaller, reusable pieces.

Virtual DOM: React uses a virtual representation of the DOM, which enables efficient updates and rendering of UI components.

JSX syntax: JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code within their JavaScript code. This makes the code more readable and easier to understand.

One-way data flow: React uses a one-way data flow architecture, which means that data only flows in one direction, from parent components down to child components.

React Native: React can be used to build not just web applications, but also mobile applications using React Native, which allows developers to use the same codebase for both web and mobile applications.

<!-- Question 3 List five major advantages of React -->

Performance: React's virtual DOM and efficient rendering algorithms make it one of the fastest front-end frameworks available.

Reusability: React's component-based architecture promotes code reuse, which makes it easier to develop and maintain complex applications.

SEO-friendliness: React is SEO-friendly because it renders HTML on the server side, which makes it easier for search engines to crawl and index the pages.

Community support: React has a large and active community, which provides a wealth of resources, tutorials, and open-source libraries.

Compatibility: React is compatible with many other tools and frameworks, making it easy to integrate with other parts of the tech stack.
